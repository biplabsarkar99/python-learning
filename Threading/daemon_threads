'''
Example setting up the daemon threads
A daemon thread runs without blocking the main program from exiting.
And when main program exits, associated daemon threads are killed too.
We pass the extra argument daemon=True while creating Thread a. This is how we specify a thread as daemon thread.
The program exits even though daemon thread was running.
